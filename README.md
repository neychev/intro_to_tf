This repository presents tiny introduction to Deep Learning with TensorFlow framework. The seminars are based on YSDA and Stanford CS materials. 

For now these materials were used in following courses:
* MIPT ML course
* Sberbank intensive ML course (in collaboration with [BigDataTeam](http://bigdatateam.org))

*PyTorch implementation coming soon.*
